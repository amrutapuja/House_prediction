# House_prediction
This project leverages machine learning to predict house prices based on various features like location, size, number of rooms, and other amenities. Using datasets such as [Your Dataset Source, e.g., the Kaggle House Prices dataset], the model is trained to identify patterns and relationships between these features and the market value of homes.
